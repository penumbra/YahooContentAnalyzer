# Analyzing the Newsgroup Content
## Open Calais
The OpenCalais Web Service automatically creates rich semantic metadata for the content you submit â€“ in well under a second. Using natural language processing (NLP), machine learning and other methods, Calais analyzes your document and finds the entities within it. But, Calais goes well beyond classic entity identification and returns the facts and events hidden within your text as well.

The OpenAmplify Web Service is the first and only of its kind. It exposes, via an open API, 250 man-years of development effort in a web service based upon more than a dozen granted patents. OpenAmplify simply does a better job of surfacing the meaning of web content, at massive scale and speed. Here's an overview of the thinking and technology that makes it possible.
